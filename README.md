# ShortSlothDiscordBot
A Discord bot that began with CodeDex's base instructions, now expanded to include requested functionality for a 200+ member server!

Functions include:
- Meme generator, using an open-source Reddit Image API
- A Death Roll game, using Discord's API functions to generate game messages and check for accepted games
- A real-time message scanning system, using File I/O to track the number of times users say Brainrot-related phrases

TO-DO:
- Weather function, which will take a user-specified location (city or zip code) and generate current weather stats for that region
